Description:

Bomberman clone for CS340. This is a two player game in which the objective is to destroy your opponent with a bomb. In the game there are some walls that are destructible and those are there so that players can use some strategy. The original BomberMan was our inspiration for this project. For rules on how to play, please visit the info section in the game.
